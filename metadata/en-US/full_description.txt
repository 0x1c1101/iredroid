IReDroid is a free and open-source infrared remote control application that transforms your Android device into a universal remote control. Control TVs, air conditioners, set-top boxes, and other infrared-controlled devices using your phone's built-in IR blaster.

<b>Key Features:</b>
• Universal remote control for IR devices
• Support for multiple protocols (NEC, RC5, RC6, Samsung32, Raw)
• Create and customize remote control layouts
• Import remotes from Flipper Zero IR database
• IR fuzzing for code discovery and device testing
• Modern Material Design interface
• Completely free with no ads or tracking

<b>Supported Protocols:</b>
• NEC - Most common protocol used by many manufacturers
• NECext - Extended NEC protocol for enhanced functionality
• Samsung32 - Samsung-specific 32-bit protocol
• RC5 - Philips RC5 protocol with Manchester encoding
• RC6 - Philips RC6 protocol with advanced features
• Raw - Custom timing patterns for unsupported protocols

<b>Advanced Features:</b>
• IR Fuzzing - Systematically test code ranges to discover working commands
• Brute force testing for unknown devices and protocols
• Code discovery tools for reverse engineering remote controls
• Protocol analysis and timing validation

<b>Privacy Focused:</b>
IReDroid respects your privacy with no internet permissions, no data collection, and no tracking. The app works completely offline and only requests the IR transmitter permission needed for functionality.

<b>Requirements:</b>
• Android device with infrared (IR) blaster
• Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher
• IR transmitter hardware support

The app automatically detects if your device has an IR blaster and provides clear feedback about compatibility. Simply point your device at the target appliance and control it just like a traditional remote control.

Perfect for users who want to consolidate their remote controls, replace lost/broken remotes, or discover new IR codes through systematic fuzzing and testing.
